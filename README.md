# NN-VQA


We introduce a general framework called neural network encoded variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), or NN-VQA for short, to address the challenges of implementing VQAs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

The detailed codes and data of the paper * Neural network encoded variational quantum algorithms * are listed below.
